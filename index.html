        when Loop’s founder (Wasim Abu Salem) was at the age of 13, he really
        wanted to learn about technology and business. He has dreamt of building
        his future technological startup aspiring to achieve great success.
        Wasim did not find the required environment and business support to
        build his skill set. Therefore, he concluded that he has to create a
        solution for the next generations that will most likely look for similar
        support. In his teenage years, he’d always think about providing an
        alternative school system that is not old-fashioned, but a more modern
        one. Therefore, with his passion for business, technology, and the
        understanding of the need for a change to the education system, he began
        his long process, with design and careful thinking towards his
        initiative, which eventually became Loop in 2015; an impact-driven
        technological organization that is built to last (Watch the story behind
        Loop).

      Our Name & Logo ​The word Loop means repeating the same action multiple
      times. Since we all mentor our peers, we all learn from each other and we
      all aim to benefit from this system, the Loop logo gets a strong meaning
      where we teach, learn, and benefit. The mentorship aspect of Loop promotes
      the idea of a lifelong journey and an ongoing system in which participants
      later can become mentors for the following generations, contribute to the
      community and even become Loop partners, thereby completing the loop of
      knowledge.
